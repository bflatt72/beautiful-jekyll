### Motivation is a load of bull! 

#### How to build consistency doing anything worth doing: for the lazy and unmotivated.

How many times have you been in a fitness forum and seen someone say something like, “I’m back guys, I was doing really well with my fitness routine but I fell off the wagon. But now I’m back and looking for motivation to keep me going.”
A lot, right?
How many times has someone told you, “yea I know I really need to start exercising or eating better or stop smoking but….” Maybe tomorrow, huh? Next year? Thing is tomorrow never comes.
People are waiting around for the motivation to do anything and when that motivation isn’t forthcoming they founder.
I’m here to tell you that motivation is a lie!
Yeah I said it, I meant it. Someone had to say it. It’s an excuse and will lead to a life of inaction and regret.
The truly great don’t wait to be motivated, they just do whatever it is they know needs to be done in order to reach their goals.
That’s why it’s important to have goals more defined than just to exercise for 30 minutes every day.
I know all of this from personal experience because I used to be that guy. I woke up one day 40 years old and 50 lbs over weight and experiencing another failed relationship and a midlife crisis.
I finally had enough.
I realized something had to change and that something was me.
I’ve been in the gym now consistently for 2 years and 9 months. I started out 236 lbs at 5'8 at around 40% body fat, with high cholesterol and blood pressure. A ticking time bomb of laziness and regret. I’ve been as low as 172 lbs and back up to 196 after bulking this past winter. I’m currently at 186 and working on getting down to 165 to 170.
I started out not even being able to bench press 135 lbs for 5 reps and just the other day I did 230 lbs for 3 sets of 5.
I’m not the biggest or strongest and I don’t have a 6 pack but I’ve come a very long way and I have learned a few things and made quite a few mistakes but I’m sometimes astounded that after 2 years and 9 months I’m still here because this is quite literally the only thing in my life that has stuck.
I’m not an Instagram fitness model. In fact I go by @JustaDudeFitness on there because I want everyone to know that I AM just a dude with a job and a family.
I’m just an average Joe. I am nothing special and I know one thing for a fact and that is that if I can do this then anyone truly can. My results aren’t astounding by any means but I do have results.
I have made great progress and I have absolutely mastered the art of consistency.
I’ve made mistakes along the way and my progress has not been a straight linear line. Instead it’s been full of ups and downs and starts and fits but again, I’ve absolutely mastered the art of consistency and that’s where I think I can help the most.
Newton said that a body at rest tends to stay at rest unless acted upon by an outside force and a body in motion stays in motion unless acted by an outside force.
This is the law of inertia and it explains how difficult it is for anyone to start anything new, let alone fitness and getting healthier and even when they do start most don’t stick with it. They might stick with it for a month or two then they “fall off the wagon” which usually starts with one missed workout that then snowballs into a week and then you realize you haven’t been to the gym in 3 months.
That’s how it happens. It’s easy. TIME can get away from us. Then we feel guilty and we hate the fact that we are spending money on the gym membership every month and not utilizing it so we start going again for a month or so and then fall off again and start the process over and over again with very little results to show for it.

I really don’t know why it finally clicked with me when it did. I’m literally one of the laziest guys on the planet. And yet I can count on one hand and still have fingers left how many scheduled gym days I’ve missed in that time which has taught me that the number one thing, the most important aspect to obtaining results in the gym isn’t having the perfect workout routine but consistency. You simply have to be consistent in order to see the results that you want so how have I, one of the world’s laziest dudes on earth, been able to do it?
Habit. It’s really that simple. There is science to back this up and I think it has been said that it takes something like 3 weeks for a new habit to be ingrained in your brain. If you do something consistently for 3 weeks you will build a habit that will be more difficult but not impossible to break.
Goals. This is the difference between merely exercising and training. Exercise is boring. It’s about getting the heart rate up and burning calories. It takes more discipline to do because it is so boring.
Training on the other hand means you have a goal in mind. Maybe you want to finally bench press 2 plates.
Well that’s not going to happen if you’re not consistent.
It’s not going to happen if you train haphazardly without a plan.
Everytime I step in the gym I know exactly what it is I need to accomplish that day.
Every time I step in the gym I’m pushing for PR’s, either a rep PR or a weight PR.
If I were to miss a day it would throw the whole routine off.
If I waited an extra week to hit Bench Press again for instance I would be detrained a bit and would miss reps.
I’m excited about every chance I get to go to the gym because PR’s and beating what I’ve done in the past is amazingly addictive and it builds on itself. You wanna do more.
This applies to cardio and running too. I believe the reason why so many people hate cardio that otherwise love the gym is because they don’t treat it in the same manner. They know about training for goals with the weights but when it comes to cardio they just hit the elliptical for 30 minutes 3 times a week and that’s boring as hell.
You have to force yourself to do that but instead of say running a mile or two 3 times a week what if instead you tried to increase the distance or your speed? What if you trained your cardio just like you did the weights instead of treating it like exercise?
I trained for and ran my first 5k last November. It was never boring. I knew every day what my goal was and I went out each and every time with that goal in mind. I had a training plan and I never missed a day.
People will say they don’t have TIME but that’s BS too. People make time for what is important to them. The fact is that their health and fitness just isn’t that Important to them.
You never hear people say they’d love to play more video games or watch more TV but they just don’t have time.
No, it’s always the things that people SHOULD be doing that they can’t find time for.
They always find time for everything else.
And it’s not just laziness because as I’ve admitted I’ve always been extremely lazy myself. It’s ALL about what’s important to you.
If it’s important to you then you’ll make the time for it no matter what and if it its not then you’ll make excuses.
But don’t say you don’t have the time.
We all have the exact same 24 hours in a day. I work 12 hour night shifts and I have a family and children but I always make time for the gym.
Sometimes I have to explicitly plan it out ahead of time how I’m gonna make it to the gym and sometimes that means going even though I’ve only had 3 hours of sleep. Sometimes it means waking up 2 hours early but the gym has become important to me and it’s become a habit and it’s become something that I couldn’t imagine not doing anymore so I do it no matter what, whether I’m tired or don’t feel like it or not feeling motivated.
Discipline not motivation. Motivation comes and goes. It’s nice when it’s there but it’s simply not needed. With self discipline you train yourself to do what’s necessary REGARDLESS of how you feel.
Feelings are fleeting. Discipline is forever.
Some days I feel great and motivated and gung ho. Many other days I simply do not, but I don’t let that be a factor in my decision making.
I’ve ALREADY decided what I’m gonna do.
I’ve ALREADY made up my mind.
It’s just up to me to execute.
If I’ve worked a 12 hour night shift but know I have to run a couple miles before eating breakfast and going to bed then that’s what I do even if I’m tired. Especially if I’m tired. That’s how you train your discipline which can be trained just like any other attribute. Some days I’m dog tired but I still do it. I don’t even let it enter my consciousness that I may succumb and not do it.
I simply do not allow myself that option.
Now of course there are days where I think how nice and easy it would be to just hit the hay instead of the gym or the treadmill or the pavement or how easy it would be to just stay in bed. There are days I say “man I’m just so damn tired maybe I’ll just stay in bed today. One day won’t hurt.” But then I just as quickly realize that even if I were to stay in bed another 2 hours I’d STILL wake up tired anyway so I might as well get up now and so I do.
This is where having a routine can really help. I get up and take a 15 or 20 minute hot shower and then I dress and make my pre workout drink and I’m out the door.
And let’s talk talk about this BS notion we tell ourselves that missing one day wont hurt, shall we? First of all, that’s how it starts, with missing “just one day” that turns into one week and then a month and then you’ve quit and you’re done.
I already know this about myself. I know that if I miss one day I’ll miss several.
Secondly, and as alluded to before, it’s all about the difference between exercise and training. Whenever anyone tells me it wont hurt to miss one day I always tell them that if all I was doing was exercising they might be right but I’m training and I can’t afford to miss any training or I’ll set myself back.
Yes, motivation is BS. It’s all about finding something you love and then making a habit out of it and building the self discipline to follow through.
If you wait around to be motivated you’ll wait your entire life and die with regrets.
